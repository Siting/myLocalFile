\section{Problem 3: High Speed Routers}

\subsection{part 1}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Each forwarding engine has a complete set of the routing tables. Traditionally, routers kept a central master routing table and the satellite processors each keep only several latest used routes. This leads to the problem that if a route information is not available in the satellite processors, then requests need to be made to obtain the information from the central master routing table. Therefore, at high speeds, the cost of requesting routing table multiple times is much higher than processing the packet header.

By letting each forwarding engine has a complete set of routing tables would overcome the bottelneck issue.
